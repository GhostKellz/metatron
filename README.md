## 🌌 Overview

**Metatron** is the **flagship LLM and orchestration engine** of the GhostStack ecosystem — a transcendent synthesis of intelligence, security, and light-speed computation.

Designed as the *"voice and scribe"* between human intent and machine reasoning, Metatron unites distributed Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with cryptographically verifiable data provenance and zero-trust inference.

It is not just an LLM — it is the **conductor of models**, the **scribe of data**, and the **voice of reason** across your AI infrastructure.

## ⚙️ Core Philosophy

* 🜂 **Sovereign Intelligence** — locally orchestrated, cryptographically verified.
* 🜁 **Retrieval-Native** — memory and recall fused into the attention fabric.
* 🜃 **Agentic Awareness** — understands, routes, and delegates between expert models.
* 🜄 **Zero-Trust by Design** — every token, embedding, and context is verified.

## 🧠 Key Features

### 🧬 Mixture-of-Experts Runtime

* Adaptive **top-k routing** across specialized experts (code, logic, safety, synthesis).
* Expert containers are **hot-swappable**, with per-expert quantization (4/8-bit).
* Supports dynamic load balancing and remote expert streaming.

### 🧮 Context + Memory

* **Retrieval-Augmented Attention**: integrates retrieval vectors *within* attention.
* Multi-tier memory: KV-cache → episodic (Qdrant) → corpus (MinIO).
* Provenance-aware data recall (signed + hashed).

### 🔐 Security + Provenance

* Fully integrated with **Veridion** for I/O validation.
* Signed training datasets and retriever outputs.
* Optional SBOM + attestation logs for compliance.

### 🚀 Performance + Serving

* Triton/TensorRT backend with CUDA/ROCm auto-detection.
* Native Zig async runtime with parallel inference dispatch.
* Supports GGUF, Safetensors, and ONNX model formats.
